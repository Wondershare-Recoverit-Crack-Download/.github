# How to Use Wondershare Recoverit
Download and Install: Download Wondershare Recoverit from the official website and install it on your computer (Windows or macOS).

Launch the Software: Open Wondershare Recoverit and select the location where your data was lost (e.g., internal hard drive, external USB, memory card, etc.).

Choose the Scan Mode: Choose either the Quick Scan or Deep Scan mode depending on the nature of the data loss. For most cases, a Quick Scan should suffice, but for more serious cases of corruption or partition loss, the Deep Scan mode is more effective.

Scan and Preview: Let the software scan your device. Once the scan is complete, you can preview the recoverable files. Select the files you wish to restore.

Recover Files: After previewing, select the files you want to recover and click the Recover button. Make sure to save the recovered files to a different drive or location to avoid overwriting the data on the original storage device.
